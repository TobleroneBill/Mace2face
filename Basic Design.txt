Basic Game Idea - MACE TO THE FACE

BALL AND CHAIN [MACE] THAT CAN BE MOVED BY CLICKING WITH MOUSE

Right click to toggle its attach point onto on object
from there it will dangle, so if on a moving platform it will go with it
I think the objective is to just slam into enemies and kill them

TODO:
	- Make moving platform work
	- Connect function on the Mace so it sticks to an object
	- Make a test level where the objective is to destroy some boxes
	
	---- MECHANIC IDEA ----
	I think the main mechanic will be areas where the player can move the flail, but the mouse cannot interact
